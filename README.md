# 🌦️ Hey! I'm Alexa!

I’m currently taking a **Weather and Climate Data Analytics** course, where I’m exploring how data science can deepen our understanding of atmospheric systems.

I am interested in learning more about how to expand my data science skills while expanding upon my weather knowledge 🌤️.

## I have a lot of outdoor hobbies including 
- 🪂 Paragliding
- 🏂 Snowboarding 
- 🧗 Ice climbing
